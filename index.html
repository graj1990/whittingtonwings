          <p>Once a month, the Wing Disciples gather. Each contender brings their own wings — marinated, seasoned, or sauced in secrecy.</p>
          <p>The host provides the grill, the drinks, and the arena. One by one, each contender takes their turn at the grill, cooking their wings to crispy, saucy perfection.</p>

        <div id="commandments-full" style="display: none;">
          <p>Wings are served in rounds — hot off the grill — and sampled by all.</p>
          <p>When the final bite is eaten, the voting begins. Everyone gets one vote (and no, you can’t vote for yourself).</p>
          <p>The contender with the most votes claims the win. No cash. No trophy. Just pride, trash talk rights, and a place on the leaderboard.</p>
          <p>Victory isn’t given — it’s earned.</p>
